#Welcome
This is my pass at implementing the Front-End / Full Stack real-time chat server.  

#Setting up
To run by checking out, follow these steps:
* Once checked out, run `npm init`
* To develop, I've used Watchify to auto-compile my react code into something the browser can understand.  To do this, run `npm run compile-react` in a separate terminal tab so it's always running
* To start the node.js server, simply run `npm start`
